This repository automatically generates a plugin containing the data from a pull request.<br>
To use it, create a new issue and provide the number of the pull request you want to download.<br>
Once the script finishes, it will close the issue and upload a zipped plugin to the releases page.<br>
Thanks to zuckung for creating the core Python script.<br>
More detailed instructions can be found on the [wiki page](https://github.com/TheGiraffe3/PR-to-plugin/wiki).<br>
